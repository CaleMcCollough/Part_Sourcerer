# Part Sourcerer
An open-source set of tools for managing parts for Bills of Materials and 
design components written in Python. Part Sourcerer works by entering in the 
web address for a part on a supplier's website (currently only works with 
digikey.com). Software then extracts all metadata from supplier's website, and 
downloads datasheets and 3D models into customizable folder structures. (In the 
future) The user can also enter in the search entry they used to search for the 
cheapest part, and the software will automatically suggest cheaper parts. Right 
now this software is being developed to use with DipTrace (diptrace.com), but I 
would like to integrate other PCB CAD software.
